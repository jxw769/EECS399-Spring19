These are the most up-to-date EAGLE PCB files. 
One Problem with our design is that the comparator outputs needs to be pulled down to Vdd-2V, and we tried to use a linear regulator for this purpose. The problem is, however, that linear regulators cannot sink current, and therefore our comparator output would drag the 1.2 V linear regulator output to 3.3 V on which the comparator is run. One workaround is to add a small resistor from the linear regulator's output to ground, and therefore making the linear regulator always source current. This is not a good idea and is only a temporary workaround. Please redesign this part of the circuit.
